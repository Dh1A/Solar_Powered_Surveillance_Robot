The idea of ​​this project is new, in fact we propose to realize a surveillance robot
Capable of making a permanent video surveillance, controlled remotely from
Anywhere, and most importantly, renewable energy will be
The importance of this energy and especially the solar energy, it is simple to design this robot
With rechargeable batteries via a solar panel. Indeed, we want to keep a rhythm of
Permanent operation, allowing the robot to be operated as long as possible without
That there is no need to stop to charge its batteries from a power source.
